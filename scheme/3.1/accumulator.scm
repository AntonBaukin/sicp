; Extends task 3.1 by making this function a high-order.
; It accepts the accumulating operation, and supports
; arbitrary number of arguments. To get current value,
; just call it without arguments.

 (define (accumulator . args)
  (if (null? args) value

 ; Gambit Scheme dislikes lambdas with just a var-args
 ; (arguments list starting with dot). We defined
 ; ordinary function and return it here:
 accumulator
)

; Applies given accumulator (actually, a visitor pattern)
; to each of the arguments following and returns it back.
(define (accumulate-each accumulator . args)
 (for-each accumulator args)
 accumulator ;<â€” allows to invoke it in a chain
)
